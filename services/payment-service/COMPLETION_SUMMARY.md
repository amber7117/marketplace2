## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Payment Gateways:**
  - Stripe SDK v13.10.0
  - Axios for HTTP requests
  - Crypto for signature generation
- **Security:** JWT, Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting
- **Validation:** express-validator
- **Development:** Nodemon

## 🎨 Key Design Patterns

### 1. Gateway Abstraction
```javascript
// Unified interface for all gateways
const gateway = GatewayFactory.getGateway('stripe');
const result = await gateway.createPayment(...);
```

### 2. Timeline Tracking
```javascript
// Every status change is recorded
payment.addTimeline('completed', 'Payment successful');
// Creates audit trail for compliance
```

### 3. Automatic Expiry
```javascript
// TTL index automatically deletes expired payments
expiresAt: { type: Date, expires: 86400 } // 24 hours
```

### 4. Service Integration
```javascript
// Seamless wallet credit on topup
await axios.post(`${WALLET_SERVICE_URL}/api/wallets/deposit`, {...});
```

## 📊 Payment Flow Examples

### Topup Flow (充值)
```
1. User → POST /api/payments (type: topup, gateway: stripe)
2. Payment Service → Create Payment record (status: pending)
3. Payment Service → Stripe API (create payment intent)
4. Payment Service → Return clientSecret to user
5. User (Frontend) → Stripe.js (confirm payment)
6. Stripe → Webhook to Payment Service
7. Payment Service → Update payment (status: completed)
8. Payment Service → Wallet Service (credit balance)
9. Wallet Service → Balance updated ✅
```

### USDT Flow
```
1. User → POST /api/payments (type: topup, gateway: usdt)
2. Payment Service → Generate wallet address + QR code
3. User → Send USDT to address (external wallet)
4. User → POST /api/payments/:id/verify-usdt (txHash)
5. Payment Service → TronGrid API (verify transaction)
6. Payment Service → Update payment (status: completed)
7. Payment Service → Wallet Service (credit balance)
8. Wallet Service → Balance updated ✅
```
